Man-In-The-Middle Attack Framework: MITMf

MITMf aims to provide a one-stop-shop for Man-In-The-Middle and network attacks while updating and improving existing attacks and techniques. Originally built to address the significant shortcomings of other tools (e.g Ettercap, Mallory), it’s been almost completely re-written from scratch to provide a modular and easily extendible framework that anyone can use to implement their own MITM attack.

Bettercap

bettercap is a complete, modular, portable and easily extensible MITM tool and framework with every kind of diagnostic and offensive feature you could need in order to perform a man in the middle attack.
Motivation

Does a complete, modular, portable and easy to extend MITM tool actually exist?

If your answer is “ettercap”, let me tell you something:

    ettercap was a great tool, but it made its time.
    ettercap filters do not work most of the times, are outdated and hard to implement due to the specific language they’re implemented in.
    ettercap is freaking unstable on big networks … try to launch the host discovery on a bigger network rather than the usual /24
    yeah you can see connections and raw pcap stuff, nice toy, but as a professional researcher you want to see only relevant stuff.
    unless you’re a C/C++ developer, you can’t easily extend ettercap or make your own module.

 

Indeed you could use more than just one tool … maybe arpspoof to perform the actual poisoning, mitmproxy to intercept HTTP stuff and inject your payloads and so forth … I don’t know about you, but I hate when I need to use a dozen of tools just to perform one single attack, especially when I need to do some black magic in order to make all of them work on my distro or on OSX … what about the KISS principle?

So bettercap was born …
