ZeroNet

Decentralized P2P websites using Bitcoin crypto
and the BitTorrent network

ZeroNet uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a decentralized censorship-resistant network. Users can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the website. Websites will remain on-line even if it is being served by only 1 peer.  When a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates done to the site content. ZeroNet counts with a build-in SQL database. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The DB is also synced with hosting nodes with incremental updates.

Usage:
Host site without central server (peers)
